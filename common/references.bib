  ABSTRACT = {The improvements to ad-hoc IR systems over the last decades have been recently criticized as illusionary and based on incorrect baseline comparisons. In this paper several improvements to the LM approach to IR are combined and evaluated: Pitman-Yor Process smoothing, TF-IDF feature weighting and modelbased feedback. The increases in ranking quality are significant and cumulative over the standard baselines of Dirichlet Prior and 2-stage Smoothing, when evaluated across 13 standard ad-hoc retrieval datasets. The combination of the improvements is shown to improve the Mean Average Precision over the datasets by 17.1\% relative. Furthermore, the considered improvements can be easily implemented with little additional computation to existing LM retrieval systems. On the basis of the results it is suggested that LM research for IR should move towards using stronger baseline models.},

  ABSTRACT = {Current prognostic models in PALF are unreliable, failing to account for complex, non-linear relationships existing between multiple prognostic factors. A computational approach using ANN should provide superior modelling to PELD-MELD scores. We assessed the prognostic accuracy of PELD-MELD scores and ANN in PALF in children presenting to the QLTS, Australia. A comprehensive registry-based data set was evaluated in 54 children (32M, 22F, median age 17 month) with PALF. PELD-MELD scores calculated at (i) meeting PALF criteria and (ii) peak. ANN was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Outcomes were classified as good (transplant-free survival) or poor (death or LT) and predictive accuracy compared using AUROC curves. Mean PELD-MELD scores were significantly higher in non-transplanted non-survivors (i) 37 and (ii) 46 and transplant recipients (i) 32 and (ii) 43 compared to transplant-free survivors (i) 26 and (ii) 30. Threshold PELD-MELD scores â‰¥27 and â‰¥42, at meeting PALF criteria and peak, gave AUROC 0.71 and 0.86, respectively, for poor outcome. ANN showed superior prediction for poor outcome with AUROC 0.96, sensitivity 82.6\%, specificity 96\%, PPV 96.2\% and NPV 85.7\% (cut-off 0.5). ANN is superior to PELD-MELD for predicting poor outcome in PALF. }

  ABSTRACT = {We describe a new method for constructing custom taxonomies from document collections. It involves identifying relevant concepts and entities in text; linking them to knowledge sources like Wikipedia, DBpedia, Freebase, and any supplied taxonomies from related domains; disambiguating conflicting concept mappings; and selecting semantic relations that best group them hierarchically. An RDF model supports interoperability of these steps, and also provides a flexible way of including existing NLP tools and further knowledge sources. From 2000 news articles we construct a custom taxonomy with 10,000 concepts and 12,700 relations, similar in structure to manually created counterparts. Evaluation by 15 human judges shows the precision to be 89\% and 90\% for concepts and relations respectively; recall was 75\% with respect to a manually generated taxonomy for the same domain.}

Although the transformation has been extensively studied, no bibliography of the published research exists at present. An attempt is made here to review the work relating to this transformation.},
